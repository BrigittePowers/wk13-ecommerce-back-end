## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
``

## Getting Started

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

### Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
